@Fawzan : I'm carazy. :D


Corrupt.c:
==========

There is no any compile or runtime error. But those variable that declared in program does not used. So there is warning.

Min.c:
======

Variable currmin is initialized with MAXINT. but it is not defined in any where. So we have to define it using following command.
	#include <limits.h>

	#define MAXINT INT_MAX

The if condition inside for loop should change as follows 
	if (Array[i] < currmin)



Numbers.c:
==========

In following statement, There is semi-colon used. This is wrong. So we have to remove it.
	for(x=43; x<12423; x++);

And in printf function there is used single quoto like this
	printf('x = %d \n', x);
But there should be used double quoto => printf("x = %d \n", x);

Theta.c:
========

To use malloc function we have to write include statement => #include <stdlib.h>

in giveMeSomeMemory function the str varible should defined as static to use the memory allocation in other functions.
	static char * str ;

And also the define statement should remove. (#define NULL 0)
cause NULL is already defined in stdlib.h

#include <stdlib.h>
